## Example

**Input:**  
a robot learned to sing in paris
**Generated Story:**  
a robot learned to sing in paris, which was a rare occurrence in the early days of science.

"This would have been a really big deal. I think that we could have had a huge surprise," Mr. Aoki said. "We'd have had an announcement like this, and we could have seen a lot of people talking about it."

The team found a way to use a computer program called a D-Wave to sing the song, using a technique called a 'voice register' that has evolved over time. The team used a software that is so powerful that it can record high-quality audio.

The technique was also used to create a computer program that could translate a melody into a song, known as an echolocation program.

Professor Bijou said that the study was a milestone for the field of artificial intelligence. "We now know that this new technology can do a lot," he said. "The future is bright though."

The study was published in the journal Science.
